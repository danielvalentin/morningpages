<h1>FAQ</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>What is this site, anyway?</dt>
	<dd>It’s simple. It’s a site in which you write. You just touch your finger tips to the keyboard and write. For a
	more detailed explanation of what the concept of Morning Pages are, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist's_Way" title="Morning pages on Wikipedia">check out the Wikipedia page here</a>.</dd>

	<dt>Isn’t this just blogging?</dt>
	<dd>The simple answer would be, “no.” No one else is reading this. This is not meant to be shared. This is for
	you and you alone. There are no headings. There are no titles. All there is is you. If you want people to
	read your writing, there are plenty of websites in which you can write and share with the world. This,
	however, is not one of them. This is between you and no one else.</dd>

	<dt>So you want me to give you all of the personal details of my life? No thanks!</dt>
	<dd>We don’t want you to give us anything. We want you to have an organized way to write your Morning Pages. Although all of your posts are hashed and encrypted even if they gain access to our database, we completely understand the fears one may have about posting all of their deepest thoughts on the Internet. If that’s you, then maybe this isn’t the best website for you to become a member of. No hard feelings!</dd>

	<dt>Why did you make this site?</dt>
	<dd>A close friend of mine told me how much he benefited from writing every day so I gave it a shot and I
	have to say I loved it. After using the website <a href="http://750words.com" alt="750 Words">750words.com</a> for a month, they started charging me. I
	completely understand why they did. I just couldn’t afford to have another bill so I tried making my own.
	After a couple of failed attempts, an absolutely fantastic developer bailed me out and it wasn’t long before
	version 1.0 was complete. Without him, I’d still be hacking away at some poorly written PHP.</dd>

	<dt>When I write, I can't press the submit button. What gives?</dt>
	<dd>The writing is based off of writing three pages of text. Once you hit 750 words, you can manually submit your writing. If, however, you write less than that, Morning Pages will auto-save after ten seconds and at the end of the day whatever you have written will be saved for later viewing.</dd>

	<dt>Who are “I” and “him?”</dt>
	<dd>I am <a href="https://twitter.com/_ellenbrook" title="Eric Ellenbrook on Twitter">Eric Ellenbrook. (@_ellenbrook on Twitter)</a>. And he is Daniel Valentin (Hi!).</dd>

	<dt>How do you make money?</dt>
	<dd>We don’t. Enjoy.</dd>
